# roblox nextbot possession (wip)
are you ever player nico's nextbots on roblox?
if so, will you ever wanted to make own nextbot possession?
if yes want - there my project for you which you can download and use as example!
(warning: this may not be working properly! if you need so you can rescript it as you needed and taking damage from possessed bots is still W.I.P!!)

# includes
- ServerScriptService SERVER scripts
- LOCAL scripts for gui and etc
- ReplicatedStorage remote/bindable events
- MODULE scripts for extra features
- an already configured example of a nextbot with which the possession system will work
- testing RBXL file if you want to get original copy of my system
- configured screengui (may not be compatible with your screen resolution)
  - to fix that simply increase frames size

# requirements
- brains
- roblox studio
- hands
- at least basic lua and luau knowledge

# installation
## easy way:
- download entire rbxl file and open it using roblox studio
## hard way:
- download all scripts and rbxm files
- extract them in roblox studio correctly
  - (module) means MODULE script
  - (server) means SERVER script
  - (client) means CLIENT script
  - make sure server scripts inside ServerScriptService
  - make sure module scripts inside ReplicatedStorage possession folder
